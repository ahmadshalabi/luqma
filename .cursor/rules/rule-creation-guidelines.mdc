# Rule Creation Guidelines

## File Format

You must:
- Store rules in `.cursor/rules/`
- Use `.mdc` extension (Markdown with YAML frontmatter)

## Metadata

```yaml
---
description: "Brief summary for Agent to understand rule"
globs: ["**/*.ext"]  # Optional: file patterns
alwaysApply: true    # Optional: true/false (default false)
---
```

### alwaysApply: true

You should use for:
- Project context
- Critical security standards
- Git conventions

### alwaysApply: false (with globs)

You should use for:
- Language-specific standards
- Directory-specific rules

Glob patterns:
- `"**/*.java"`: All Java files
- `"backend/**/*.java"`: Java files in backend
- `"frontend/src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"`: Frontend source files

### alwaysApply: false (no globs)

You should use for:
- General standards (Agent decides relevance)
- Specialized rules used occasionally

## Writing Style

You must write rules that target AI agents (like Cursor Agent):
- Use direct commands: "You must...", "You should...", "You must never..."
- Use second-person imperative (not instructional style)
- Write actionable rules, not explanations
- Be concise and specific

Examples:
- ✅ Good: "You must use constructor injection only"
- ❌ Bad: "Constructor injection is preferred because..."

## Quality Standards

You must:
- Keep under 500 lines
- Focus on one topic per file
- Use bullet points and clear headings
- Avoid redundancy
- Write clear descriptions for intelligent application
- Use conventions over implementation (what, not how)
- Include minimal examples (only for structure/context)

You must simplify to essentials:
- Remove detailed explanations
- Remove tutorials and step-by-step guides
- Remove redundant checklists (rules already state requirements)
- Remove "philosophy" and "when to use" sections
- Keep only core principles and actionable rules

## When to Create

You should create when:
- Repeating same guidance multiple times
- ADR decisions require enforcement
- Tech stack-specific conventions needed
- Project-specific standards needed

You should not create for:
- One-off situations
- General software principles
- Implementation tutorials
- Well-known best practices

## Content

You must include:
- Conventions and standards
- Tech stack-specific patterns
- Brief examples for structure only

You must exclude:
- Step-by-step implementations
- Verbose explanations
- Duplicate information
- General programming advice
- Multiple similar examples

## Maintenance

You must:
- Review periodically
- Remove outdated info
- Avoid duplication (reference other rules)
- Keep minimal
