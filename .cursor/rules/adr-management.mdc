# ADR Management Standards

## Format

You must:
- Store ADRs in `docs/decisions/`
- Use MADR 4.0.0 format
- Name files: `NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`
- Use `docs/decisions/adr-template.md` as template

## Workflow

When creating ADR, you must:
1. Find next sequential number
2. Create file with descriptive title
3. Set status: "accepted", date: YYYY-MM-DD
4. Update `docs/decisions/README.md` with link

## Required Sections

You must include:
- YAML frontmatter (status, date)
- Title (short, representative)
- Context and Problem Statement (2-3 sentences)
- Considered Options (2-3 alternatives minimum)
- Decision Outcome (chosen option with consequences)

## Optional Sections

You may include:
- Decision Drivers
- Pros and Cons of Options
- More Information

## Rules

You must:
- Use concise language
- Document why alternatives were not chosen
- Keep ADRs immutable (only status changes)
- Link related ADRs in "More Information"
- Reference ADRs in code comments when relevant
- Use tables for comparing multiple options

You should create ADRs for:
- Technology selection
- Architectural patterns
- API design decisions
- Security decisions
- Major refactoring

You should not create ADRs for:
- Bug fixes
- Styling tweaks
- Routine tasks

## Status Changes

**New decision:** status: "accepted"

**Supersede old decision:**
1. Create new ADR with next number
2. Update old ADR status: "superseded by ADR-XXXX"
3. Reference old ADR in new one: "Supersedes ADR-YYYY"
4. Explain why original decision changed

**Minor updates only:**
1. Make content changes
2. Keep original date
3. Add note at bottom: "Updated: YYYY-MM-DD - Brief reason"

You should update (not supersede) for:
- Fix typos or grammar
- Add clarifications
- Add links to related ADRs
- Add implementation references
- Improve formatting

You must supersede (not update) for:
- Changing the decision
- Different approach chosen
- Technology replacement
- Architectural shift
