# Backend Documentation Standards

## Code Documentation

You must prioritize self-documenting code (clear naming, well-structured code).

You should document:
- Why, not what
- Complex algorithms
- Business rules
- Non-obvious decisions
- Public APIs

You must not document:
- Obvious code
- What code does (should be clear from code)
- Outdated information

## JavaDoc

You must document:
- Public APIs (controllers, services)
- Complex business logic
- Non-obvious behavior
- Public interfaces

You should skip:
- Private methods (unless complex)
- Getters/setters
- Obvious one-liners
- Test methods

You must:
- Write first sentence brief, ending with period
- Use present tense: "Calculates" not "Calculate"
- Use third person: "Returns" not "Return"
- Document @param, @return, @throws
- Explain why, not what

## API Documentation

You must use OpenAPI/Swagger:
- @Tag on controllers
- @Operation on endpoints
- @ApiResponse for all status codes
- @Schema on DTOs with examples

You must:
- Write descriptive summaries (action-oriented)
- Document success and error cases
- Provide realistic example values
- Document constraints (min, max, pattern)
- Mark deprecated endpoints
