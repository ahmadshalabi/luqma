# Frontend Security Standards

## API Key Protection (CRITICAL)

You must NEVER include API keys in:
- Frontend code
- Environment variables (even VITE_ prefixed ones)
- Git commits

You must:
- Call backend only, never external APIs directly
- Never store secrets in frontend

## Input Validation

You must validate at client-side for UX feedback only:
- Provide immediate feedback to users
- Never rely solely on client-side validation
- Always validate on backend

You must prevent:
- XSS: Escape HTML, validate all input
- Avoid dangerouslySetInnerHTML unless absolutely necessary

## Content Security Policy

You must:
- Set CSP headers to restrict resource loading
- Only load resources from trusted sources

## Dependencies

You must:
- Enable automated scanning (Dependabot)
- Check for updates weekly
- Apply security patches immediately
- Run: npm audit
