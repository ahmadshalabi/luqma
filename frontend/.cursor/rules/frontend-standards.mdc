# Frontend Development Standards

## Component Architecture

You must:
- Keep components under 200 lines (break up larger)
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

## React 19 Features

You should use:
- use(): For reading resources/promises
- Actions: For form submissions
- useOptimistic: For better UX
- useFormStatus: Form state

## State Management

You should use:
- useState: Simple local state
- useReducer: Complex state logic with multiple sub-values
- Context API: Shared state across component tree
- Custom hooks: Encapsulate and reuse stateful logic

## Context API

You must:
- Always memoize context values with useMemo
- Memoize actions with useCallback
- Split contexts by concern
- Wrap useContext in custom hooks

## Performance

You must:
- Debounce search inputs (300ms)
- Use React.lazy() for code splitting
- Use virtual scrolling for long lists (100+ items)
- Use stable keys for lists (not index)

## Vite

You must:
- Prefix client-side env vars with VITE_
- Use @/ alias for src/
- Access env vars via import.meta.env

## TailwindCSS

You must:
- Use utilities only (never inline styles)
- Use mobile-first approach: base → sm: → md: → lg:
- Use sr-only for screen reader only text
- Use focus:ring for visible focus indicators

## React Router

You must use:
- useParams(): Route params
- useNavigate(): Programmatic navigation
- Link: Internal navigation
- Lazy routes: Load on demand

## Accessibility

You must ensure:
- Semantic HTML: nav, main, article, button
- aria-label for buttons without text
- Logical keyboard navigation (tab order)
- Descriptive alt text for images

## API Communication

You must:
- Use centralized client (one api.js)
- Never call external APIs (through backend only)
- Handle loading/error/empty states
- Use native Fetch API (no axios)

## Testing

You must:
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use query priority: getByRole → getByLabelText → getByText
- Use userEvent over fireEvent
- Achieve 70%+ coverage
