# Frontend Documentation Standards

## Code Documentation

You must prioritize self-documenting code (clear naming, well-structured code).

You should document:
- Why, not what
- Complex algorithms
- Business rules
- Non-obvious decisions
- Public APIs

You must not document:
- Obvious code
- What code does (should be clear from code)
- Outdated information

## JSDoc

You must document:
- Custom hooks
- Complex utility functions
- Context providers
- Shared components with props

You should skip:
- Simple components
- Inline functions
- Obvious utilities

You must:
- Include type information with @param and @returns
- Mark optional params in square brackets [param]
- Document default values
- Document object shapes for destructured params
